        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Minimal Access/Laparoscopic Surgery is a surgical technique which involves small (keyhole) incisions instead
            of large cuts. The surgeon introduces a telescope with a video camera through this incision into the body
            cavity and operates by viewing the internal parts on a TV monitor. In traditional open surgery, the surgeon
            is unable to see directly into the patient without a large incision. The video camera efficiently becomes a
            surgeon’s eyes in minimal access surgery, since to perform the procedure; the surgeon uses the image from
            the video camera placed inside the patient’s body. When the abdomen is operated using a telescope, the
            procedure is called laparoscopy. On the other hand, when used in a joint, it is called arthroscopy, and when
            used in the chest, the procedure is called thoracoscopy

            This minimal access surgery helps in early recovery of patients as they are usually walking around in a few
            hours after the surgery and can resume their daily activities in no time. Laparoscopic surgery causes
            minimal pain and has excellent cosmetic results. When compared to traditional open surgery, in laparoscopic
            or minimal access surgery patients experience less pain, less scarring and have a shorter recovery time.
            Minimal access surgery can successfully treat thyroid and parathyroid, hernia, appendix, anorectal
            conditions, diseases of gastrointestinal tract, gall bladder stones and certain clinical conditions
            involving pancreas, adrenal glands, spleen, kidneys and the liver.
